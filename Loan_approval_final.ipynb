    "# Digitizing Loan Approvals for Financial Inclusion: A Machine Learning Approach for Kenyan Microfinance Institutions (MFI's) and Digital Lenders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya’s financial landscape is rapidly evolving, with microfinance institutions and digital banking both playing pivotal roles in expanding access to financial services. MFIs have historically bridged the gap left by traditional banks, providing small, accessible loans to underserved communities, women, and small businesses groups often overlooked by mainstream banks. However, MFIs face challenges such as high interest rates, slow manual processes, and limited digital transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, digital banking is driven by high mobile penetration and platforms like M-Pesa, Loop, and Branch. It offers instant, AI-driven loan approvals, lower operational costs, and seamless integration with mobile money. Yet, digital banking also faces challenges, including data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and limited reach in remote areas without smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved (loan_status: Approved/Not Approved). The solution will help MFIs and digital lenders automate approvals, improve decision fairness, and streamline operations, supporting the shift toward a hybrid, inclusive, and efficient financial ecosystem in Kenya."

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders:** Microfinance institutions, digital lenders, mobile banks, applicants (especially women, small businesses, and rural communities), fintech investors, and regulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context and Value Proposition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MFIs:** Continue to be a lifeline for the unbanked and small businesses, but must digitize to remain competitive. Digitization can reduce bureaucratic delays, lower costs, and expand reach.\n",
    "- **Digital Lenders:** Offer instant, AI-based approvals and lower fees, but must address data privacy, cybersecurity, and inclusion for non-smartphone users.\n",
    "- **Applicants:** Benefit from faster, fairer, and more accessible credit, especially women and rural entrepreneurs who have historically been underserved.\n",
    "- **Regulators:** Are evolving policies to ensure responsible lending and consumer protection as digital banking grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Trends and Opportunities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The future of finance in Kenya is hybrid: MFIs are digitizing, and digital banks are expanding to underserved communities.\n",
    "- Group lending models and community-based approaches remain important for risk reduction and inclusion.\n",
    "- There is a strong push for financial inclusion, women’s empowerment, and support for small businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Deliver a supervised ML model that enables automated, fair, and efficient loan approvals, supporting MFIs and digital lenders in Kenya’s transition to a more inclusive, digital, and resilient financial sector."
